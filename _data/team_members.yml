  describe: A person from Sichuan and Chongqing who doesn't eat spicy food. I hope I can travel a lot on the scientific research Road (lie flat as soon as possible). Not long after I entered the programming pit, I usually either debug or write bugs. Hobbies include the sea, snow mountains, soup making, writing pain literature and basking in the sun.
